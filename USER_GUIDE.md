ABOUT PROJECT :

This report provides an in-depth exploration of the methodology applied to process and analyze the automotive.jsonl dataset, part of the Amazon Reviews 2023 collection. 
The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis to determine whether a customer review was positive or negative, 
leveraging both the review's content and its rating.
The project encompassed several key stages, including extracting and transforming the dataset from the JSON Lines (JSONL) format, performing comprehensive preprocessing 
to prepare textual data for analysis, and designing a deep learning model using TensorFlow. 
Along the way, we encountered various challenges, including handling unstructured data, balancing class distribution, and optimizing the model for performance.

INSTRUCTION :

1. Set Up Your Environment:

   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.6 or higher).
   Install the necessary libraries. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   bash
   command :   pip install pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
  
2. Load the Dataset:
   
    Ensure that the automotive.jsonl dataset is in the correct directory. You can convert it into a CSV format as outlined in your document (use parsing.py)

3. Model Development :  Use TensorFlow to create and train your sentiment analysis model using lstm,dense layer , dropout layer etc.

4. Evaluate the Model:  After training, evaluate your modelâ€™s performance  and use for prediction

RESULT: 

Review: Decent product, but could be improved.
Sentiment: Positive (confidence: 82.45%)
